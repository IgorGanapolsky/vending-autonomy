Hi {comp} team,

I'm Igor Ganapolsky, a Broward-based operator interested in your free-placement vending program.
I'll handle location scouting, servicing oversight, and reconciliation,
and in exchange would like to keep {COMMISSION_SPLIT} of net sales on **{PRODUCT_FOCUS}** machines.

Could we discuss next steps? You can reach me at {SMTP_USER} or simply reply to this email.

Best,
Igor
